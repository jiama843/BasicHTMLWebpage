    <h2 style = "margin-left: 75px">Hello World! My name is Jia.</h2>
    <p style = "margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 50px"> For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated with change and self-improvement. And what can better represent growth aside from the technological advancements that have been rapidly developing before our very eyes?<br>
    <br> Well anyways, to learn more about programming and expand my knowledge, I have chosen to pursue an undergraduate degree for Computer Science at Waterloo! So if you're curious about me in terms of education, I'm currently registered as a Waterloo undergraduate student.</p>

    </a>
    <br>
    <p style = "margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 50px"> Well education aside, I was born in China but came to Canada at an early age. I am relatively fluent in two languages: English and French. <br><br>I believe I posess a good amount of initiative, but I can probably think of a few other people I know that outmatch me in that aspect.<br><br>However! When I get into something, I can work efficiently for hours on end to complete my task... ...The only problem is, I am fairly bad with fine print. Whether I'm reading a book or taking a test or debugging some code, I sometimes overlook minor things that can contradict some of the effort I put in. <br><br> And it just so happens that overlooking small details is the greatest pet peeve of software creation! <br> My greatest ambition in life is to found a successful software company one day. Happy programming everybody!
